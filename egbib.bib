abstract="There is an undeniable communication problem between the Deaf community and the hearing majority. Innovations in automatic sign language recognition try to tear down this communication barrier. Our contribution considers a recognition system using the Microsoft Kinect, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and GPU acceleration. Instead of constructing complex handcrafted features, CNNs are able to automate the process of feature construction. We are able to recognize 20 Italian gestures with high accuracy. The predictive model is able to generalize on users and surroundings not occurring during training with a cross-validation accuracy of 91.7{\%}. Our model achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.789 in the ChaLearn 2014 Looking at People gesture spotting competition.",

abstract="This chapter discusses sign language recognition using linguistic sub-units. It presents three types of sub-units for consideration; those learnt from appearance data as well as those inferred from both 2D or 3D tracking data. These sub-units are then combined using a sign level classifier; here, two options are presented. The first uses Markov Models to encode the temporal changes between sub-units. The second makes use of Sequential Pattern Boosting to apply discriminative feature selection at the same time as encoding temporal information. This approach is more robust to noise and performs well in signer independent tests, improving results from the 54{\%} achieved by the Markov Chains to 76{\%}.",
